// Values and Variables

/*
Declare variables called country, continent and population and assign their values according to your own country (population in millions).

Log their values to the console.

let population = 18000000;
let continent = "North America";
console.log(country);
console.log(continent)

// Data Types
/*
// Declare a variable called isIsland and set its value according to your country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable language, but don't assign it any value yet.

// Log the types of isIsland, population, country and language to the console.
